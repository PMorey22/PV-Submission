We were both young when I first saw you, I closed my eyes and the flashback
starts I'm standing there on a balcony and sun are air
See the lights, see the party, the bargas see you make your way through the crowd and say hello
to the fire know that you were throwing pebbles and my daddy said stay away from
Julia and I was crying on the staircase begging you please don't go
and I fear you'll take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting all there's nothing to do is run you'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes
so I sneak out to the garden to see you we keep quiet because we're dead if they knew so close your eyes
I'll skip this town for a little while and I'll go because you were on me oh I was a scarlet better and my daddy said stay away from Julia
but you were everything to me I was begging you please don't go
and I said don't be afraid you'll take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting all there's nothing to do is run you'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes
for me oh say me they're trying to tell me how to feel this time is difficult but it's a rigging
don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess it's a love story baby just say yes
I got a waiting wonder and if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading when I met you on the asker to tell and I said when you're saved me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come as this in my head I don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pull the ring and said marry me Julia
it's another hot to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I'm talk to your dad go pick out a white dress
it's a love story baby just say yes
hello young when I first saw you
